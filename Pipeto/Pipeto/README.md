# G-SEC-210 Project: Pipeto Console

## Project Overview
The **Pipeto Console** is a command-line interface (CLI) designed to simulate the operation and management of a nuclear reactor. This project is part of the G-SEC-210 module and focuses on secure software development practices, including vulnerability identification, mitigation, and secure coding techniques.

The console provides a variety of commands to interact with the reactor's systems, monitor its status, and simulate emergency scenarios. It also includes hidden features and challenges to test the user's ability to identify and secure potential vulnerabilities.

---

## Features
- **Reactor Initialization**: Safely start the reactor and prepare it for operation.
- **Status Monitoring**: Check the reactor's core temperature, coolant flow rate, and radiation levels.
- **Emergency Protocols**: Activate emergency shutdowns and simulate meltdown scenarios.
- **System Diagnostics**: Run diagnostics and monitor critical system parameters.
- **Configuration Management**: Load and configure reactor settings.
- **Hidden Features**: Includes secret commands for advanced users.
- **And even more!**
